A stylized emblem featuring a bold red shield with a white silhouette of a school mascot (e.g., a lion or eagle) centered in the middle. The shield has a subtle gradient from deep crimson at the top to a lighter scarlet at the bottom, giving it depth. The mascot is rendered in white with clean lines, standing upright with its front paws slightly raised, as if in motion. The background is a solid white field that contrasts sharply with the red shield, ensuring the logo is eye‑catching and legible at small sizes. The overall composition is balanced, with the shield centered and the mascot occupying roughly two‑thirds of the shield’s height. The design conveys energy, teamwork, and school spirit while remaining simple and elegant.
